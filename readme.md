# The Wallet App

This project will help you cover most of the knowledge you've learned so far in JavaScript into practice.

You are required to create this using OOP and a css framework (eg. Bootstrap) and use only Vanilla JS

## Functionality

- The app should be able to manage multiple wallets
- A wallet has a name, starting balance, a list of Transactions, and description
- The wallets should be saved and loaded from a storage (with thier data)
- There should be 2 types of transactions (Income and Expense)
- A transaction should have a date, tags, and a note
- a user can jump between the wallets and create wallets

## Classes

Every object in this app should be a class. For instance:

- Wallet
- Transaction
- Expense
- Income
- Currency

And class related logic should be put as methods inside the respective class (either static or instance)

Listeners and UI updating methods can sit outside of the classes
